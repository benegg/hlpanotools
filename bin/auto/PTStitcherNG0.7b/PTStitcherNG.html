<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
PTStitcherNG
reads and transforms any number and type of input
images, and combines them into one seamless panoramic image with
larger field-of-view. Given enough input images, full spherical 360x180 degree
views can be synthesized suitable for virtual-reality viewers or printing.
Transformation parameters and names of the input images are read from a
plain-text projectfile. The transformations consist of correcting distortions
due to camera lenses, perspective tranlation and remapping to any of the
usual panorama projections. Merging employs an eight level multiresolution 
algorithm which hides seams even if the source images
fit badly.  PTStitcherNG natively reads PPM, TIFF and JPEG images,
and almost any raw or other format through plug-ins. 
</p>
<p>
PTStitcherNG combines a panorama stitcher and multiresolution blender
in one application. It is optimized for speed by using parallel processing
(SIMD-instructions, multiple processor cores). The main novel
feature is the tight coupling of the remapper and blender, with an optimized
management of temporary data. This enables PTStitcherNG to keep all intermediate
data and processed images in ram (in the case of the CUDA-version: in 
gpu-ram) even when stitching hundreds of images to gigapixel sized 
panoramas. As a result, no data have to be written to disk, 
or reread from disk with corresponding  speed improvements. As an aside, this makes 
PTStitcherNG perform fast 
even on low profile host systems
</p>
<p>
Some speedresults, obtained with my fastest platform
(Intel Celeron 1.8GHz, 1 GByte ram, Nvidia GeForce GTX 285, OpenSUSE 11.1):
</p>
<p>
3 x 11 MPixel ------->  18 MPixel equirect 2.1 sec 
(the decimal point is correct)
<br>
For source images and project files see <a href="http://360image.de/test/smallfoot.htm">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
337 x  6 MPixel ------->1433 MPixel cylinder 250 sec (4min 10 sec)
<br>
For source images and project files see <a href="http://hdview.at/speedtest/speedtest.zip">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
The cellprocessor version (Playstation 3) has been discontinued: Recent decisions by Sony 
(new PS3 without Linux) and IBM (dim future for the cellprocessor)
made me switch to CUDA as one basis for PTStitcherNG.
Friendly folks from Nvidia sent me one of their gpu-cards
for evaluation. However, PTStitcherNG also runs very fast on plain vanilla
current x86 systems. 
</p>
<p>
PTStitcherNG is free software. No license is required to download and use it. 
See the licenses for auxiliary components in the Licenses folder.
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
All versions of PTStitcherNG are copy-installed, i.e. the necessary program
files are simply copied to a suitable location on your computer. No automatic
"installer" corrupts your system by manipulating low-level settings.
</p>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>
The Windows version of PTStitcherNG has now been tested to work on Windows 7.
Binaries for 32bit and 64bit platforms, with and without CUDA are provided.
Use one of the files <i>PTStitcherNG_cuda.exe</i> or <i>PTStitcherNG.exe</i>.
<i>PTStitcherNG.exe</i> should run as is, while
the CUDA-version requires two libraries (dlls):
The file <i>pano_cuda.dll</i> from the distribution,
and Nvidias CUDA-runtime <i>cudart.dll</i> which is now
included in the distribution. You also need Nvidias CUDA-driver
(and, of course, a CUDA-capable grapics card):
Download from <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_get.html">Nvidia</a>
and install it.
 


<h3>X86-MacOS</h3>
<p>
Only the non-CUDA version of PTStitcherNG is available for Macintoshs.
Simply copy the files <i>PTStitcherNG</i> (the actual program) and the file <i>PTStitcherNG.app</i>
(an AppleScript GUI-wrapper for PTStitcherNG) to your computer.

The default PTStitcherNG application is compiled for MacOS 10.5 (Leopard). 
There is no version for older versions of MacOS or PowerPC processors.
</p>

<h2>Extending PTStitcherNG</h2>
<p>


As is, PTStitcherNG reads TIFF, JPEG and PPM-images. Reading RAW and other
formats is accomplished by external readers, which feed PPM-data to
PTStitcherNG. Once setup, this is done automatically. On startup PTStitcherNG
reads a textfile <i>PTImageReader.txt</i>, which contains fileextensions and program commands,
see the example of the distribution. Download and install <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dcraw">
dcraw</a> for
reading almost any RAW format, <i>pngtopnm</i> for reading PNG images, or
any other of the <a href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/">netpbm</a> 
utilities for almost any format. The distribution now includes dcraw. Just move
it to the same folder as the PTStitcherNG executable together with the
<i>PTImageReader.txt</i> file. Edit <i>PTImageReader.txt</i> to set special dcraw
options, e.g. for using 16bit-pixels etc.
</p>
<p>
PTStitcherNG writes TIFF (multilayer using "tiff_m" and single layer "tiff", see 
scriptsyntax below),
PPM ("ppm"), PSD / PSB and JPEG images. Pixelsize defaults to 3-byte RGB. The commandline
option <i>-p</i> switches output format to 6-byte RGB (only PPM and TIFF). Large files
exceeding 2GByte size can be written in PPM and (flat) TIFF-format, provided the operating
system and file format permits it. In the case of TIFF-multilayer format, a filename
with extension ".btf" or ".tf8" has to be used to force BigTIFF format on Linux and MacOS,
the Windows-version supports multilayer format only for regular TIFFs. 
</p>

<h2>Using PTStitcherNG</h2>
<p>

PTStitcherNG can be run as standalone programs with minimal graphical user
interface. Simply drag and drop a suitable projectfile (e.g. the <i>speedtest.pts</i>-files
from the above mentioned speedtests) onto PTStitcher's icon (in the
case of MacOS: onto PTStitcherNG.app's icon). You will be asked for a save-location,
and PTStitcherNG will then proceed and convert the input images.
</p>
<p>
PTStitcherNG can be run as a console application from the command line with many
more options to finetune the conversion process. This might be used for 
batch-processing large amounts of images using shell scripts. 
See the man-page <i>ptstitcher_man.pdf</i>
for details.
</p>
<p>
Finally, PTStitcherNG can be registered  into
one of the many graphical frontends to panorama tools, see the docs of your
favorite system for details.
</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>
The distribution includes a small sample project which can be used to test
the installation. Open the folder <i>test</i> and locate the file <i>project.txt</i>.
Drag and drop this file onto PTStitcherNG's icon (on Macs: on PTStitcherNG.app's icon).
PTStitcherNG should start up, ask for a save-location and convert the 6 images to
a cylindrical panorama. Open the file <i>project.txt</i> with any plain-text editor,
and change the settings to test other features, see the documentation on scripting syntax below.
To run PTStitcherNG from the commandline, open a console window,
navigate to the <i>test</i>-folder, and issue the command
<br>
<tt>..\win\PTStitcherNG.exe -o pano.tif Project.txt </tt> on Windows
<br>
<tt>../mac/PTStitcherNG -o pano.tif Project.txt </tt> on Macs
<br>
In this mode all commandline switches can be tested, see the PTStitcherNG manpage.
</p>
<p>
For larger panoramas and to test image quality, download any of the speedtest
examples mentioned above: 
<a href="http://360image.de/test/smallfoot.htm">  18 megapixel sphere </a> or 
<a href="http://hdview.at/speedtest/speedtest.zip"> 1433 megapixel cylinder </a>.
</p>


<h2>Projectfile</h2>
<p>
Projectfiles are plain-text files generated either by hand using any texteditor
or (usually) using one of the panorama tools utilities for aligning images, e.g.
PTOptimizer, which is integrated in most graphical frontends to panorama tools.
A subset of PTStitcher  and PTGui scripting parameters is supported:
<p>
One line describing the output panoramic image:
<br>
<b>p &nbsp;  w</b><i>width</i> &nbsp; <b>h</b><i>height</i> &nbsp; 
<b>f</b><i>projection</i> &nbsp; <b>v</b><i>field-of-view</i> &nbsp; <b>n</b><i>fileformat</i>
<br>
<i>projection</i> is one of 0 (rectilinear), 1 (cylinder), 2,4 (equirectangular),
3 (spherical equidistant), 5,10 (spherical equisolid), 6 (spherical mirror). 
Two formats provide perspectively corrected projections for large fields-of-views:
The multiple-rectilinear format (11), for examples see
<a href="http://www.fh-furtwangen.de/~dersch">here</a>, and the 
<a href= "http://wiki.panotools.org/The_General_Panini_Projection">Panini-format </a> (19).
Both require additional parameters which are documented in separate articles.


<br>
<i>fileformat</i> = PPM, PSD, PSB, JPEG, TIFF, TIFF_m (TIFF-multilayer). In the case of JPEG-ouput,
the quality (<i>q</i>=0...100 and progressive-flag <i>g</i>=0,1 can be set in a quoted string like
n"JPEG q95 g0". TIFF files are limited to approximately 2 Gigabyte filesize, except if the 
BigTIFF extension is selected. This is done either in the script by
specifying <i>b1</i> as option to TIFF or TIFF_m like n"TIFF b1". If standard, non-layered, 
(and non deferred, see manpage) TIFF-output is selected, PTStitcherNG automatically chooses
this format if image size exceeds this limit. However, not all current TIFF-readers are
capable of decoding this extension correctly. 
<br>
Choosing TIFF_m (TIFF-multilayer) format disables the blender. The output file consists of
a multiframe image with one remapped frame per input image. The frames are tagged with
their offset coordinates in the global panoramic image. Using this option automatically
disables blending over zenith/nadir (options -n and -z), and option -d (deferred merging).
</p>
<p>
Some notes on Photoshop native formats (PSD - up to 30000 pixels wide, PSB - up to 300000 pixels wide):
Both can be 8 or 16 bit color depths. In default mode a multilayer image is created with each
layer hosting one fixed-length rectangular tile. This tiled scheme is choosen for fast reading
and writing access, and has no resemblance to the original source images. If so desired
it can be collapsed in Photoshop onto the backgound layer without any editing or blending.
<br>
When using the '-d' (deferred merging) option, a flat 
image without layers is created. Note that as mentioned elsewhere, this option requires 
buffering of the panoramic image in memory and may not work for very large images on a low
RAM system.
<br>
The PSD- and PSB-formats have been tested to work in Photoshop CS4, but many third-party
programs do not support them or only some of their features. The MacOS image previewer does
not correctly display the multilayer variant, only the flat version. The gimp only recognizes
PSD, not PSB images. Also, multilayer 16bit-colordepth images are not rendered correctly on
this platform.
</p>
<p>
and one line describing each input image:
<br>
<b>o &nbsp; y</b><i>yaw</i><b>&nbsp; p</b><i>pitch</i><b> &nbsp;r</b><i>roll</i>
<b> &nbsp; w</b><i>width</i> &nbsp; <b>h</b><i>height</i> &nbsp; 
<b>f</b><i>projection</i> &nbsp; <b>v</b><i>field-of-view</i> &nbsp; <b>n</b><i>filename</i>
<b>a</b><i>a</i> &nbsp; <b>b</b><i>b</i> &nbsp; <b>c</b><i>c</i> &nbsp; 
<b>d</b><i>d</i> &nbsp; <b>e</b><i>e</i> &nbsp; 
<b>C</b><i>x<sub>left</sub>,x<sub>right</sub>,y<sub>top</sub>,y<sub>bottom</sub></i> &nbsp; 
<b>S</b><i>x<sub>left</sub>,x<sub>right</sub>,y<sub>top</sub>,y<sub>bottom</sub></i>
<br>
<i>yaw</i>, <i>pitch</i> and <i>roll</i> specify angles to tilt, pan and rotate the images.
<br>
C and S options specify rectangles: C specifies new image dimensions (crop), all
other parameters like field-of-view refer to these new dimensions, while S mereley selects an area by
setting the alpha channel to zero outside.
<br>
<i>a,b,c</i> refer to polynomial coefficients for distortion corrections, and <i>d,e</i>
shift the optical center of the image.
<br>
The <i>projection</i> parameter is almost identical
to the panorama case, with one exception: 2 means spherical equidistant. The spherical
formats 2 and 3 are identical except that the first variant converts a circular region
while format 3 converts the whole image. The same holds for formats 5 and 10.
<br>
The line describing imagefiles in PTGui-<i>pts</i>-projectfiles
<br>
<b>#-imgfile</b> &nbsp; <i>width</i> &nbsp; <i>height</i> &nbsp; "<i>filename</i>"
<br>
is also accepted to support script-generating programs which
do not supply the filenames for input images on the <b>o</b>-line (see above).
PTStitcherNG requires the input image names in the script. They can not be supplied on the
commandline as in old PTStitcher. Most other parameters are optional with the exceptions y,p,r.
PTStitcherNG supports the global image description line termed "#-dummyimage" in 
PTGui-projectfiles.
Identical parameters for all images, e.g. field-of-view (v) or correction parameters 
(a,b,c) can
be specified as v=0 (meaning identical to the value of dummyimage Nr.0 ), a=0 b=0 etc.
</p>
<p>
and one line describing global options:
<br>
<b>m &nbsp; i</b><i>intrepolator</i> 
<br>
with <i>interpolator</i> = 0(cubic, default),1 (spline 4x4), 2 (spline 6x6),
3 (sinc 16x16), 4 (spline 8x8), 5 (bilinear), 6 (nearest neigthbor),
7 (sinc 32x32), 8 (sinc 6x6), 9 (sinc 8x8).
</p>
<p>
Viewpoint correction is supported using 
<a href="http://www.ptgui.com/examples/vptutorial.html"> PTGui-<i>pts</i>-format</a>:
<br>
<b>#-viewpoint <i>Vx Vy Vz pan tilt</i></b>
<br>
This correction is a combination of lateral translation (Vx,Vy),
size change (Vz), and two-axis rotation (pan, tilt).
</p>

<h2>Inverse Mode</h2>
<p>
Using the command option <i>-i name</i> instead of the usual <i>-o name</i>
to specify the panorama image name switches PTStitcherNG into inverse mode.
In this mode the panorama image must exist and all images specified 
in o-lines are created. All sensible options are supported including
all warp transformations, radial distortions and perspective transformations.
The fileformat specification on the p-line (tiff/jpeg/etc) is applied to the output
images. 
<br>
<b>Caution:</b> Using PTStitcherNG this way with an existing projectfile 
previously used for panorama-<i>creation</i> overwrites all source images if they exist!
</p>
<p>
There are numerous applications for this mode: Create 6 cubic faces
from an equirectangular source for cubic panorama viewers with this script:
<tt>
<br>
<br>
p f2 v360 n"JPEG g0 q100"
<br>
<br>
o f0 y0 r0 p0 v90 w1500 h1500 n"forward.jpg"
<br>
o f0 y90 r0 p0 v90 w1500 h1500 n"right.jpg"
<br>
o f0 y-90 r0 p0 v90 w1500 h1500 n"left.jpg"
<br>
o f0 y-180 r0 p0 v90 w1500 h1500 n"back.jpg"
<br>
o f0 y0 r0 p90 v90 w1500 h1500 n"up.jpg"
<br>
o f0 y0 r0 p-90 v90 w1500 h1500 n"down.jpg"
</tt>
<br>
<br>
Sequences of images to be merged in motion images can be extracted
in a similar way to the 
<a href="http://www.fh-furtwangen.de/%7Edersch/mp/MotionPanoramas.html">mpremap</a>
 project.
